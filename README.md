# NationalMap-Catalog

The catalog (init files) for National Map. Please raise any issues at https://github.com/NICTA/NationalMap.

## Usage

You can preview the latest version of this catalog file [here](http://nationalmap.gov.au/#clean&https://rawgit.com/TerriaJS/NationalMap-Catalog/master/build/nm.json).

`gulp` compiles catalog fragments from `datasources/` into a single, minified `build/nm.json`. A list of Geoscience Australia services used is also generated in `build/ga_services.txt`.
